# CI / CD Exercise

Configure `.github/workflows/cicd.yml` to define a full CI/CD pipeline for this application

### Part 1: Write test and build job

steps:

- [x] Set up Node
- [x] Install depencencies
- [x] Execute tests
- [x] Execute build
- [x] Push the build artifact. (only If it's a push to main branch, not a PR)

### Part 2: Write deploy job

conditions:

- (only If it's a push to main branch, not a PR)
- (test and build job must have been successful)

steps:

- [ ] Download the build artifact
- [ ] Deploy to github pages

## Examples and tips

### Build step example

- Add the `VITE_APP_PUBLIC_URL` in the build environment, with the repo name value
- Build command will store the build artifact to `./dist` path.

```
- name: Build step
  run: npm ....
  env:
    VITE_APP_PUBLIC_URL: /<repo_name>/  # --> /example-react-cicd/
```

### Conditionally run a job or a step, use the `if` key.

`if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' `

### Link a job to a privious one, use `needs` key.

- executes job2 only when job1 finished successfully

```
jobs:
  job1:

  job2:
    needs: job1
```

### Deploy job needs write permissions, use `permissions.content: write`.

```
jobs:
  deploy:
    permissions:
      contents: write
```

### Share files (artifacts) between jobs

If you need to share files between jobs upload them in the repo and download them in the destination job

upload:

```
steps:
- name: Uploading build files
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: artifact
    path: <artifact_path>
```

download:

```
steps:
- name: Downloading artifact
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: artifact
    path: <artifact_path>
```

### Deploy to github pages

- use the action `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3`
- indicate which directory to publish using `publish_dir: ./<artifact_path>`

```
      - name: Deploying to gh-pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: <artifact_path>
```

### Github-pages requirements

- Repository must be public
- Enable github pages in settings
- Update “homepage” in packages.json with the URL of your github pages site
- Add VITE_APP_PUBLIC_URL env var with the repository name in the build step.
- Update <BrowserRouter> basename prop in main.jsx with the repository name.
